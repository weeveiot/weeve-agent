# weeve agent
The weeve agent is a lightweight service to orchestrate data pipelines. A data pipeline is defined in a manifest file and consists of several interconnected docker containers. The data pipeline is instantiated by subscription to an MQTT topic for the stage and node. The logic of the service then pulls images from docker hub if they do not exist on the machine. The weeve agent creates and starts containers based on a specified manifest. A bridge network is instantiated to facilitate container communication. The agent publishes status messages over MQTT on a defined interval to monitor the state of the IOT edge comprised of multiple edge nodes running weeve agents.

## Architecture
The weeve agent can be considered as a Docker orchestration layer with a purpose built business logic for a data service - multiple containers in communication with each other. As such, the project relies on the [Golang Docker SDK](https://godoc.org/github.com/docker/docker).

The main entry command initiates logging, parses flags, and passes control to the publish and subscribe MQTT client software. The [paho](github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.golang) MQTT client is used for MQTT communication. TLS is optionally configurable, and has both server and client authentication, and therefore requires the private and public key of the device as well as the certificate of the server.

A data model for the manifest object and supporting structures is found in the internal library.

[WIP] A simple web server is implemented with the [Gorilla MUX package](github.com/gorilla/mux) for debugging and inspection of the weeve agent and the device.

## Getting started

### Without TLS
The binary or the source code, (with `go run`) the agent can be started with the following options.

#### Terminal: Broker
This recipe requires a local MQTT broker, for example, the Mosquitto broker with logs enabled to confirm subscription and publish; `mosquitto -v -p 8080`.

#### Terminal: Publishing to weeve agent
With the mosquitto client tools, we can publish to the weeve agent in interactive mode (enter to send a message).
`mosquitto_pub -t nodes/localtest/local-test-node-1/deploy -p 8080 -l`

Of to send a sample manifest file, the `-f` option can be used.
`mosquitto_pub -f ./testdata/manifest/mvp-manifest.json -p 8080 -t nodes/localtest/local-test-node-1/deploy`

#### Terminal: Subscription to agent status
In a new terminal instance, subscribe to all topics for that broker; `mosquitto_sub -t '#' -p 8080`.

#### Terminal: Weeve agent
In a final terminal, run the weeve agent and connect to the broker to publish status messages;
```bash
go run <path-to-agent>/agent.go -v --notls \
	--broker tcp://localhost:8080 \ # Broker to connect to \
	--subClientId nodes/localtest \ # Subscriber ClientId \
	--pubClientId manager/localtest \ # Publisher ClientId \
	--publish CheckVersion  \ # Topic Name \
	--heartbeat 3 # Status message publishing interval
	--nodeId local-test-node-1 \ # ID of this node optional \
	--config <path-to-config>
```

The `-v` flag enables logs in terminal, and the `--notls` flag disables TLS configuation. Further logs from the `paho` MQTT client can be enabled with the `--mqttlogs` flag, and the `--loglevel` flag enables to set desired logging level.

### With TLS

#### Manual Node Provisioning
Start with registering a new Node with GraphQL or with weeve UI. Then download corresponding pem certificate and key from AWS S3 to your device as well as AmazonRootCA1.pem from Google.
Since TLS configuration requires the full path to all secrets and certificates, execute the following code:

```bash
SERVER_CERTIFICATE=<path-to-root-cert>/AmazonRootCA1.pem
CLIENT_CERTIFICATE=<path-to-cert>/<nodeid>-certificate.pem.crt
CLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY=<path-to-private-key>/<nodeid>-private.pem.key
go run <path-to-agent>/agent.go -v \
	--nodeId awsdev-test-node-1 \ # ID of this node (optional here)\
	--name awsdev-test-node-1 \ # Name of this node (optional here)\
	--broker tls://<broker host url>:8883 \ # Broker to connect to \
	--subClientId nodes/awsdev \ # Subscriber ClientId \
	--pubClientId manager/awsdev \ # Publisher ClientId \
	--publish status \ # Topic bame for publishing status messages \
	--heartbeat 10   # Status message publishing interval \
	--config <path-to-config>
	# --mqttlogs # Enable detailed debug logs for the MQTT connection
```

The `tls` protocol is strictly checked in the Broker url.

#### Automatic Node Provisioning
Clone weeve Agent code to your device and place bootstrap (group) certificates in its directory.
Download AmazonRootCA1.pem from Google. Then, follow the steps:

1) Set up nodeconfig.json with bootstrap details (see [Config Options](#config-options)):
```json
{
	"AWSRootCert": "/path/to/AmazonRootCA1.pem",
	"Certificate": "/path/to/<bootstrap_id>-certificate.pem.crt",
	"NodeId": "",
	"NodeName": "Node-Sample-1",
	"PrivateKey": "/path/to/<bootstrap_id>-private.pem.key"
}
```

1) Run command:
```bash
go run <path-to-agent>/agent.go -v \
	--broker tls://<broker host url>:8883 \ # Broker to connect to \
	--subClientId nodes/awsdev \ # Subscriber ClientId \
	--pubClientId manager/awsdev \  # Publisher ClientId \
	--publish CheckVersion \ # Topic bame for publishing status messages \
	--heartbeat 60 # Status message publishing interval \
	--config <path-to-config>
```

# Config options
All the below params can be updated into json instead of arguments as above
```json
{
	"AWSRootCert": "/path/to/AmazonRootCA1.pem",
	"PrivateKey": "/path/to/<node private key/bootstrap private key file name>",
	"Certificate": "/path/to/<node certificate/bootstrap certificate file name>",
	"NodeId": "<node id>", //Empty initially for auto registration
	"NodeName": "<node name>" //Node name for auto registration
}
```

# Containerization
Weeve agent can also run in a container given the right environment. Currently we support container orchestration in the secunet container environment. To create a container run `make secunet` in the top project directory. This will create a container `secunet-test` ready to be deployed on a secunet gateway. It can then be deployed using the repository [secunet deployment](https://github.com/weeveiot/secunet-deployment).

# [BELOW IS WIP]

The latest binary can be downloaded from S3 bucket :
https://weeve-binaries-release.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/node-service/node-service-0-1-1

The compiled binary found as a release can be executed by specifying the port to be exposed;

`./node-service -v -p 8030`
The `-v` verbose flag is optional and will present the Debug level logging messages.

### Docker container
Currently, running the project with Docker is not supported. Since the main function of the Weeve Node Service is to orchestrate a set of docker containers, running the project inside docker presents additional complexities due to the interaction with the host machine. A docker file is present to facilitate unit testing only.

## Getting started for Developers

### Prerequisites
GoLang is installed https://golang.org/doc/install

### Build the Golang project
The project can be compiled and run from source. The root of the command is the project root directory.
Build Node API Service mode
`go build -o ./build/node-service ./cmd/node-service.go`

Build Node MQTT listener mode
`go build ./cmd/node_listener.go`

### Run the Golang project
`go run ./cmd/service/node-service.go -v -p 8030`

The root of the command is the project root directory.

The `-v` verbose flag is optional and will present the Debug level logging messages.

### Unit-test the Golang project

TO clear all docker resoures before running tests, run below command,

>docker system prune -a

To get latest test result first clear cached result if any, using below command,

>go clean --testcache

Then run below command to run tests,
`go test -v ./...` OR 'watchtests.sh'

Currently, unit testing does not cover the project.

## Developer environment

Several developer features are supported in the project.

### Manually running the weeve agent as systemd service on a edge-node

1. Install docker [docker installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
2. Create a new directory and copy the following to the directory
	1. weeve agent binary (AWS: s3 bucket)
	2. nodeconfig.json and bootstrap certificates (Github repository: weeve-agent-dependencies)
3. Make the binary executable `chmod u+x weeve-agent/<agent-binary-name>`
4. Create weeve-agent.argconf file which will contain the CLI arguments for the weeve agent
```bash
ARG_VERBOSE=-v
ARG_HEARTBEAT=--heartbeat 300
ARG_BROKER=--broker tls://asnhp33z3nubs-ats.iot.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:8883
ARG_PUBLISH=--publish status
<add more arguments as required>
``` 
5. Create weeve-agent.service file which will define the service
```bash
[Unit]
Description=Weeve Agent
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
RestartSec=60s
EnvironmentFile=/lib/systemd/system/weeve-agent.argconf
WorkingDirectory=<path to the directory containing weeve agent contents>
ExecStart=<weeve agent binary path> $ARG_VERBOSE $ARG_BROKER $ARG_PUBLISH $ARG_HEARTBEAT <add more arguments as required matching the ones from weeve-agent.argconf>
```
6. Move .service and .argconf files to `/lib/systemd/system/`
7. Enable the service to start at start-up `sudo systemctl enable weeve-agent`
8. Start the service `sudo systemctl start weeve-agent`

Upon first execution;
1. The weeve agent bootstraps.
2. The thing name will be the environment followed by the ID, for example; `awsdev_f5adbd1a-d4b7-4485-b5f4-2b901a92c80f`.
3. The certificate is created and uploaded to S3

NOTE:
It is possible to run multiple instances of the weeve agent in a single host. Each process would be running independently and be bootstrapped with as a dedicated IoT thing.

### Deleting a node

To delete the IoT thing, call the API - deleteNode.
This will remove the following:

- Things from IoT core
- Node and deployments from DB
- Certificate from s3 bucket

### Dependencies

### Enhanced golang terminal
The `go` command may be replaced with the `richgo` command to provide more colorful output at the terminal. The project is found at [richgo](https://github.com/kyoh86/richgo) and installed with `go get -u github.com/kyoh86/richgo`.

### File watcher reflex
A file watcher is employed to automate the restart of the server and run tests on code change.
The file selected watcher is [reflex](https://github.com/cespare/reflex), and is installed with `go get -u github.com/cespare/reflex`.

For unit tests;
`reflex -r '\.go$' -s -- sh -c 'richgo test -v ./...'`


# [WIP] Developer testing - listener


## Testing with TLS to IOT core
Traffic between the weeve agent and the MQTT broker is encrypted with TLS.

PEM or Privacy Enhanced Mail is a Base64 encoded DER certificate.

### Server authentication
The MQTT broker presents it's certificate, which the device validates against the a

### Client authentication

The server.key is likely your private key, and the .crt file is the returned, signed, x509 certificate.
(openssl x509 -noout -modulus -in certificate.pem.crt | openssl md5 ; openssl rsa -noout -modulus -in private.pem.key | openssl md5) | uniq
#### Testing with IOT core

Status heartbeat messages can be confirmed by subscribing to the NodeID topic. A test subscription [can be viewed](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot/home?region=us-east-1#/test) if using AWS IOT Core.

The same testing UI can be used to publish back to the agent.

### Testing with mosquitto
mosquitto_pub \
	-h asnhp33z3nubs-ats.iot.us-east-1.amazonaws.com -p 8883 \
	--cafile ~/weeve/edge-pipeline-service/adcdbef7432bc42cdcae27b5e9b720851a9963dc0251689ae05e0f7f524b128c-certificate.pem.crt \
	-t test -m testing


mosquitto_pub -h asnhp33z3nubs-ats.iot.us-east-1.amazonaws.com -p 8883 --cafile AmazonRootCA1.pem -t test -m testing

## Testing with Wireshark

nslookup
ifconfig

## Testing the manifest
```bash
Local: mosquitto_pub -t nodes/localtest/{nodeId}/deploy -p 8080 -l
